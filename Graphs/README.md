# Graphs - Data Structures & Algorithms

## 📊 Overview
This folder contains implementations and practice problems related to graph data structures and algorithms.

## 🏗️ Graph Representations
- **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array representation
- **Adjacency List**: Space-efficient using arrays/lists
- **Edge List**: Simple list of all edges

## 🔍 Algorithms Implemented

### Traversal Algorithms
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Level-order traversal
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Recursive and iterative approaches

### Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Single-source shortest path
- **Bellman-Ford**: Handles negative weights
- **Floyd-Warshall**: All-pairs shortest path

### Minimum Spanning Tree
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Using Union-Find
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Greedy approach

### Other Important Algorithms
- **Topological Sort**: For DAGs
- **Cycle Detection**: Undirected and directed graphs
- **Connected Components**: Find graph connectivity

- Connected vs Disconnected graphs

## ⏰ Time Complexities
| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| BFS/DFS | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| Dijkstra | O((V + E) log V) | O(V) |
| Floyd-Warshall | O(V³) | O(V²) |
